# The nurses problem

This program tries to solve the nurses problem described 
in the **statement.pdf**

The program allows the user to create instances for the problem
using 3 different generators. 

For example, you can generate 50 instances with the generator 1
calling the following line from the terminal:

````buildoutcfg
python3 mainGenerators.py 1 50
````

There's also a config file called **paramsMainGenerators.py**.
It's a python file that have some dictionaries with parameters
for the generators.

For solving an instance of the problem you can choose between 
3 different options. The first one is calling the **GRASP** 
meta-heuristic. The second one is calling the **BRKGA**
meta-heuristic. The last one is calling the IBM linear solver
**OPL**.

For example, if you want to solve all the instances in the 
folder "./autoGeneratedData/" with the GRASP meta-heuristic
and with a time limit of 300s you can call this line from the
terminal:

````buildoutcfg
python3 mainSolvers.py ./autoGeneratedData/ grasp -t 300
````

**paramsMainSolvers.py** is a python file, like 
paramsMainGenerators.py, that contains some dictionaries with
parameters that are used to configure the solvers.

Enjoy it!!! :\)
